# IMDb Sorter

IMDb Sorter reads in a list of movies from a file and sorts them in descending order of their IMDb ratings. The result is stored in a new <code>movies_sorted.html</code> file.

### Output Format
* Modes to view program output - CONDENSED MODE and DENSE MODE.
    * In CONDENSED MODE, only the sorted movie titles and ratings are shown.
    * In DENSE MODE, the file entries are shown as they are read in from the file, along with a counter of the entry number.
    * DEFAULT: DENSE MODE
